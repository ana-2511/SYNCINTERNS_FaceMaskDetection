I am elated to share that I have completed Task 3, which was assigned to me under the domain of Machine Learning by SYNC INTERN'S. 

Topic Name= Face Mask Detection Model

The technologies used here are TensorFlow, Keras, Computer Vision. This is the first time I have delved into the field of working with these , also building CNN model included. The accuracy level that the model has achieved is around 84%. Firstly, I trained a dataset with 10000+ masked and without masked pictures, preprocessed them and used the loaded model in my final model.
